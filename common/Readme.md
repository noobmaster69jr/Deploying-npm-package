# publishing a npm package
- common is a folder that contains a bunch of functions which are used by both frontend and backend

- npm login
- npm publish --access=public


- npm pack(to check which files are published)
- .npmignore(similar to .gitignore file , add files which are to be omitted when publishing)
- after making any changes to older package, increment version
- .d.ts (declaration file , only has types. no javascript logic like console.log  )
